# ACM-W Project#1

Our first project is building a [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions). The chrome extension is designed to be a simple popup that counts down to the next school break the user inputs, or more broadly, the closest date the user inputs. The final project code is available along with step by step starter code. It's designed to be completed in three parts (three 1hr meetings) that cover HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

The required manifest file and sample icon are included.

>[!NOTE]
> This is intended for beginners, so all skill levels are welcome to participate. Our members should feel comfortable asking questions at any point.  
> **Goal**: Take what you learn to create your own **personal projects** for your portfolios  

Starter directions for HTML are on the `html-starter` branch; Starter directions for javascript are on the `js-starter` branch; final project is on the `main` branch
